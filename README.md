# Breadcrumbs E-Commerce Product Analysis

Welcome to the Breadcrumbs E-Commerce Product Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce platform to derive insights and make informed decisions. The primary tool used for visualization and analysis is Power BI, complemented by SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to analyze various aspects of sales data, including total price vs total discount, total discount by main category, number of products with maximum and minimum discounts, average rating points, and minimum rating points. The analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance, pricing strategies, and product categories.

## Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard offers an intuitive interface to explore key metrics and visualize trends in the e-commerce sales data. Here are some of the key visuals included in the dashboard:

- **Total Price vs Total Discount**: A scatter plot showcasing the relationship between total price and total discount for different products.
- **Total Discount by Main Category**: A bar chart illustrating the total discount offered in each main product category.
- **Number of Products with Maximum and Minimum Discounts**: A KPI card displaying the count of products with the highest and lowest discounts.
- **Average Rating Points**: A gauge chart indicating the average rating points for products.
- **Minimum Rating Points**: A KPI card showing the minimum rating points among all products.

## SQL Queries

To retrieve and manipulate the data for analysis, SQL queries were employed to extract relevant information from the database. These queries were crucial in preprocessing the data and preparing it for visualization in Power BI.

## Usage

To explore the project and interact with the Power BI dashboard:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (`sales_analysis.pbix`) using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the visuals and interact with the dashboard to gain insights into the e-commerce sales data.
